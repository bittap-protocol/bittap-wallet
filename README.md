### Project Structure

- `src` - main source.
  - `content-script` - scripts and components to be injected as `content_script`
    - `iframe` content script iframe vue3 app which will be injected into page
  - `background` - scripts for background.
  - `popup` - popup vuejs application root

  - `pages` - application pages, common to all views (About, Contact, Authentication etc)
  - `components` - auto-imported Vue components that are shared in popup and options page.

### Extra info

In [src/background/index.ts](./src/background/index.ts) you can find an example of chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener.

We add `?type` to the url to tell if it's update or install event. Then in [src/setup/pages/index.ts](./src/setup/pages/index.ts) we check for the `type` and show the appropriate page.

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bittap-protocol/bittap-wallet.git
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Then **load extension in browser with the `dist/dev` folder**.

### Build

To build the extension, run

```bash
pnpm build
```

And then pack files under `dist`, you can upload `dist.crx` or `dist.xpi` to appropriate extension store.
